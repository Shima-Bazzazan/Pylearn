# Assignment 11
In this section, exercises are done to familiarize and understand **object-oriented programming** in Python.

## 11.1 Fraction

In this exercise, a **class** is defined for fractions using object orientation.
In other words, we can create an **objects** of the **Fraction class** and perform operations between fractions through it's methods.

#### properties in this class:
Two numbers that are the `numerator` and `denominator` of the fraction.
#### methods in this class:
The functions that perform `addition`, `multiplication`, `subtraction`, `division` between **two fractions** and `converting` the fraction to a number, `simplifying` and `displaying` the fraction, respectively.

## 11.2 Time

In this exercise, a **class** is defined for tenses using objects orientation. In other words, we can create an **objects** of the **Time class** and perform calculations between tenses through its methods.

#### properties in this class:

The three numbers that are `hour`, `minute` and `second` of the time and calling the `fix()` to modify the time.

#### methods in this class:

Seven functions that perform `displaying` the time, `addition` and `subtraction` between **two times** and `converting` "the second to time", "time to second" and "GMT time to Tehran's time" and `fix` the time respectively.


## 11.3 Complex numbers

In this exercise, a **class** is defined for complex numbers using objects orientation. In other words, we can create an **objects** of the **Complex class** and perform calculations between complex numbers through its methods. 

#### properties in this class:

Two numbers, `real` and `image`, which form a complex number.

#### methods in this class:

Four functions that perform `displaying` the complex number, `addition`, `multiplication`, and `subtraction` between **two complex numbers** respectively.
